description
-----------

This is an evolution simulator using java2d.

Creatures interact with each other when their squares touch.
During an interaction, a creature transfers energy from the opponent based on their blue color component and height.
They lose energy based on their red and green color components and width.
Creatures also lose energy every tick based on their height, width, and velocity.

The world starts with randomly generated creatures.  New randomly generated creatures are added every so often or if the number of creatures gets low.

I'll be adding some statistical displays and inputs to change how creatures interact.
